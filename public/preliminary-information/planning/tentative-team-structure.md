What would probably be needed:
    
 - 1 Database Architecture Consultant: Someone to drive or influence the database schema decisions. In the case of such a complex database, someone who's specialty is database design is needed
 - 2 Programmers: Two fairly experienced programmers to implement the solution
 - 1 Interface designer: Someone to study the requirements of FAI and produce an easy to use interface
 - 1 Designer: Someone to design a beautiful user-facing website
 - 1 Project Manager: Someone to tie all those people together

In order to reduce costs, I can, on top of being project manager, wear the hats of designer, interface designer, and programmer (and to an extent, designer), but this will necessarily reduce my capacity to have a global overview of the project. I can't replace a Database Architecture specialist, though.
