#Timeline
- ### Month 1
    + **themes**: *Admin, Design, Interface*
    + **deliverables**: Wireframes of the admin interface ([example][ex1])
    + **description**: This month will be spent designing the admin interface
    + Note: no graphical choices will be made at that stage; the design will purely be *functional*, that is, it will describe how the interface should look and behave.
    + **team**: 1 person, me
    + **AIF**:
        * **Begin thinking about**:
            - Storage choices: price, trade-offs, architecture
            - What is the website for? Attracting new users, be a good search tool...
- ### Month 2
    + **themes**: *Admin, Proof of concept, Interface, Testing*
    + **deliverables**: A working editing interface ([example][ex2])
    + **description**: This month will be used to implement a proof of concept interface that can actually be used by the AIF archivists. The goal of building such interface is to be able to test and iterate in order to improve fast.
    + Note: the interface will be bare-bones, and that is *by design*. Since we want to be able to iterate easily, it is important to keep things flexible and not get too much into details
    + **team**: 2 people: me, programmer
    + **AIF**:
        * **Tasks**:
            - Provide constructive and constructed feedback on the pros and cons of the interface
            - Continue the conversation about storage choices
            - Continue the conversation about website orientation
        * **Begin thinking about**:
            - What type of budget will be monthly allocated to infrastructure
            - How to gather website user's feedback. Could be *potential* users or *actual* users.
            - What survey/questions would be interesting to ask them
- ### Month 3
    + **themes**: *Admin, Iteration, Database*
    + **deliverables**: Database design, improvements on the admin interface
    + **description**: This is a month to review things that work and things that don't, and begin cementing both the database design and the user interface of the admin area.
    + **team**: 2 people: me, programmer
    + **AIF**:
        * **Answer**:
            - Monthly infrastructure budget
            - Storage Choices
        * **Tasks**:
            - Continue the conversation about website orientation
            - Continue designing a survey
        * **Begin thinking about**:
            - What modules should the website feature. Rank them by *mandatory*, *would-be-cool*, *why-not*.
- ### Month 4
    + **themes**: *Admin, Design, Staging*
    + **deliverables**: A mostly finished admin interface (examples: [this][ex3] or [that][ex4], hopefully better looking)
    + **description**: At the end of month #4, admin interface will reach beta version. This means we consider it satisfying *enough* to begin actually using it with real data. Graphical elements and such will be introduced here, to make the experience more pleasant and legible.
    + **team**: 3 people: me, programmer, website designer
    + **AIF**:
        * **Answer**:
        * **Tasks**:
            - Allocate the infrastructure monthly budget
            - Send out user's feedback survey
            - Continue thinking about website modules
- ### Month 5
    + **themes**: *Migration, Database Study, Planning*
    + **deliverables**: Database Content Migration
    + **description**: This month will be dedicated to the study and the planning of a export path for the current data in the AIF database. By the end of the month, we'll either have a software to automate conversion, or just a plan for that software, depending on the complexity of said migration.
    + **team**: 2 persons: me, programmer
    + **AIF**:
        * **Tasks**:
            - Reflect on survey's feedback, continue thinking about website orientation.
            - Continue thinking about website modules
- ### Month 6
    + **themes**: *Infrastructure, Implementation*
    + **deliverables**: A useable admin interface
    + **description**: A working, secure server with the admin interface and the database. This shouldn't need a month, but since the timeline of the preceeding month is somewhat hazy, this provides some padding.
    + **team**: 1 person, me
    + **AIF**:
        * **Answer**:
            - Website orientation: It is expected from AIF to have, by that point, a somewhat clear idea of the website's purpose.
        * **Begin thinking about**:
            - How could we gather 10~20 people, a mixed sample of potential users and actual users, to get them to test the website.
