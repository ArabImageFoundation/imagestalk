		# Purpose of this Document

		The AIF needs an overhaul of their archiving system as well as a user-facing website.

		Before starting the actual project, a one month research is in order, in order to tailor the project to requirements.

		# Why

		The AIF project:

		- has an complex hierarchy of interconnected data sets
		- and a (relatively) small budget

		In order to produce a maintainable product, a thorough study would allow us to
		make sure we're planning a viable path.
