		# Why?

		> The preliminary research will allow us to conduct a *goal driven* development, which will allow for the least waste of resources possible.

		It will ultimately lead to the production of document specifying [goals](#/1/2) and [solutions](#/1/3).

		# Documentation

		All the information gathered during the research will be documented and consigned.  
		Note that this process has already begun and the documentation available can be found

section(id="/1/2")
	:markdown
		# Goal

		At the term of the research will be produced a document the will specify:

		1. Technological Specifications: what technologies will be used and why
