		# Phase 1
		## Gathering Requirements

		In close collaboration with AIF, all imperatives are gathered.
		During this phase, it is *mandatory* that members of AIF are available and responsive.  
		> All subsequent phases depend on the answers found during this process.

section(id="/2/3")
	:markdown
		# Phase 2
		## Computing Requirements

		In accordance with the findings of phase 1, a research is conducted and solution(s) found and documented

section(id="/2/4")
	:markdown
		# Phase 3
		## Benchmarking

		The different methods to reach our goals are tested for performance and compliance with the requirements.

section(id="/2/5")
	:markdown
		# Phase 4
		## Production

		A document detailing the planning for the production of the AIF archiving system & website is produced.

section(id="#/2/6")
	:markdown
		# Communication

		Particularly during phases [1](#/2/1) and [4](#/2/4), it is mandatory, 
		for the success of the research in the imparted time, that members of AIF
		are available to answer questions.
