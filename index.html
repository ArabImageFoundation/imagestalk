<ul>
<li><a href="archiving-system">Archiving system</a>, or database, or image and knowledge library</li>
<li><a href="website">Public-facing website</a></li>
<li><a href="blog">Blog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This document presents facets of the agreement made between both  parties involved in this project, <strong>Synclop</strong> and the <strong>AIF</strong>. It will be updated as needed. For more information on both timeline and structure of this project, see the <a href="project-management">project management page</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2><h3>Interconnected modules</h3><p>Though these modules are each independent from the other, their interconnectivity is a key concept. Development may be done simultaneously and/or asynchronously.</p>
<h3>User-centered design</h3><p>Each facet and module of the online platform must follow a consistent structure, and show a coherent appearance and user interface. Design should facilitate and enhance user-friendliness and accessibility. Whenever technically possible, all processes should be kept simple and short for both the user and the administrator. Redundant elements will be identified and eliminated. The user&#39;s entry barrier should be as low as possible. Responsiveness, speed and robustness are granted features that the platform should strive for within each of its aspects.</p>
<h3>Open-source solutions</h3><p>The archiving system module that will be developed for the AIF will be released for the public under an Open Source license, free to be altered and re-released by other institutions and individuals, regionally and internationally. As for the other modules, using existing open-source solutions for their development should be considered whenever possible; open-source software, services and standards.</p>
<h3>Future-proof technologies</h3><p>Each module should be built with sustainability in mind, ensuring that the platform will endure on the long run, and will be easily changed if need be. For that purpose, it is important to either use technologies that are so widely used that any developer can work with them, or provide thorough and comprehensible documentation, easily picked up by an average local developer if needed.</p>
<h3>Extensibility</h3><p>At any moment, staff of the AIF might need to add keywords or new object types to the archiving system, thus its development should allow administrators to manipulate, create, and edit object types.</p>
<h3>Cost efficiency</h3><p>Being a non-profit institution, the AIF relies on funds and grants to sustain its activities and the development of its projects. Hence solutions that require recurrent payments (especially if the payments are high) will be less favored than pay-and-forget solutions. In other words, effort will be undertaken to keep server requirements on the low-end, as well as minimize the use of technologies that require a subscription.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2><h3>Synclop</h3><ul>
<li>Counsel on strategic decisions, especially those tied to the project</li>
<li>Counsel on User Interface/User Experience decisions</li>
<li>Write technical requirements</li>
<li>Deliver products</li>
<li>Deliver documentation</li>
<li>Respect agreed upon timeline and budget</li>
<li>In case of a considerable change in timeline or budget, alert the AIF ahead or time to come up together with a suitable solution</li>
</ul>
<h3>Arab Image Foundation</h3><ul>
<li>Answer questions in a timely manner</li>
<li>Provide clear specifications (will be helped in this by Synclop)</li>
<li>Sign on requirements and specifications (and once agreed, not change them later)</li>
<li>Provide any documentation Synclop might need</li>
<li>Pay as agreed by both parties</li>
</ul>
<h1>Preliminary planning</h1><p>There are three paths we can take to achieve this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build on what we have.<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> We don&#39;t have to redesign a database</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> We profit from accumulated experience with a system that we know</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> We don&#39;t get to redesign the database :(</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> We inherit code bloat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a ready-made product<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> We use something that is market-ready and tested</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Easily picked up for changes and already documented</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> We loose flexibility</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> We loose performance (it will come with features we don&#39;t need)</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> We probably can&#39;t import easily the current data (or maybe not at all)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start from scratch<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Full freedom</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Performance</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> Re-inventing the wheel and re-encountering problems that have already been solved</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> Need to be documented thoroughly if someone else is to maintain the product after</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
