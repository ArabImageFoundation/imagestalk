<ul>
<li><a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">Relational Databases</a>: Relational databases store data in tables. It might help to visualize them as excel sheets. Data in relational databases is <em>normalized</em> and <em>structured</em>. Relational databases also have developed a set of features that allow them to guarantee writes; in other words, in case of failure, the data stays uncorrupted. This set of features is referred to as</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a>: In computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>: &quot;SQL&quot; stands for &quot;Structured Query Language&quot;. It refers to the language that is used in the earliest databases to instruct the database how to store or retrieve data. By extension, it has become synonymous with &quot;relational databases&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>: NoSQL refers to a new wave of databases that are non-relational. Some of them <em>do</em> use SQL language, so the appellation is often a misnomer, and should be understood as &quot;not relational&quot;, and not as &quot;not using SQL&quot;. NoSQL databases include, but are not limited to:<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database">Document databases</a>: Databases that store information as a tree; A good visualization is a file system (folders containing other folders containing files). Document databases are specially useful for nested data, for speed, and for flexibility (since the data is, by design, not normalized, it&#39;s easy to add properties to any object). They have a reputation of being ACID-adverse, but huge technological improvements have been changing this in the last year.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">Graph databases</a>: Databases that establish links between things. This is specially useful for arbitrarily linking two objects (&quot;nodes&quot;, in graph parlance) with a link (&quot;edge&quot;) specifying a certain relation. They are widely used in social networks (X is &quot;friends&quot; with Y, A is &quot;going out with&quot; B). The landscape of Graph databases is mostly bare, with only a few dominating ones.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database">Key-Value Store</a>: Very simple databases that store every piece of data under a key. Imagine an excel sheet with only two columns, one of which is an identity field you can&#39;t fiddle with. The extreme simplification allows for extreme speeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>to sum it up</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relational databases</strong> express data as &quot;X <em>is</em> made of A, B, and C&quot;, such as &quot;a book <em>is</em> made of title, number of pages, and author&quot;. They have been in use for years and most problems that might arise have been already solved.</li>
<li><strong>Document databases</strong> express data as &quot;X <em>contains</em> A, B, and C&quot;, such as &quot;Contact <em>has</em> an address, the address <em>has</em> a street, a city, and a state&quot;. They are new, and hard problems are still arising nowadays.</li>
<li><strong>Graph databases</strong> express data as &quot;X <em>is in relation with</em> A, B, and C <em>and the quality of their relation is Y</em>&quot;, such as &quot;Alice <em>is friends with</em> Bob and Bob <em>is a member of</em> the local chess club&quot;. Graph databases are complex and as a result, very few open-source solutions are available today.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, to make things a bit more complex, some databases are <em>mixed</em>. OrientDb is a graph database that incorporates some relational features. PostgreSQL is a relational database, but as of it&#39;s latest version can also store and search &quot;documents&quot;.</p>
<p>In the case of the highly relational data we are dealing with, a graph database would make a lot of sense (photo X is &quot;in&quot; album Y, and is &quot;defined by&quot; terms A,B,and C), but choosing a graph database would mean doing away with ready-made solutions, as well as sacrificing somewhat future maintainability (most people have not even <em>heard</em> of noSQL databases, let alone graph databases).</p>
</section><section id="hosting-platforms-section"><h2 id="hosting-platforms-section-title" class="autoTitle"><a href="./hosting-platforms">Hosting Platforms</a></h2><p>Hosting platforms (where the website will reside) can be roughly categorized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared Hosting: This is the least costly solution. Server is shared between many users. There is a terrible loss in performance, but as most websites don&#39;t require much, in a lot of cases, this is enough. However, special solutions cannot be installed on shared hosts (typically), which means losing quite a good amount of flexibility</li>
<li>Private Dedicated Managed Server: This is the most costly solution, but the most flexible too. As the name implies, a machine is dedicated to your website only.</li>
<li>Private Dedicated Self-Managed Server: This is the same as above, but slightly less costly, as you are supposed to manage the server yourself. Any problem that arises is yours to fix (unless it&#39;s a hardware problem). Which means you have to hire your own IT, but having someone on a retainer fee might be enough</li>
<li>Private Virtual Managed Server: This is a mid-way between shared hosting and private servers. It&#39;s a private server, but in the cloud, and distributed over multiple PCs. The cost is also in the middle between a shared host and a private server</li>
<li>Private Virtual Self-Managed server: As you can guess, this is a virtual private server you manage yourself</li>
<li>Cloud Platform: This is the equivalent of a VPS (Virtual Private Server), but it scales up automatically with your requirements, so it can end up being much stronger than a dedicated server. However, the pricing scheme is often complex, very low as long when your requirements are low, but climbing up exponentially as your requirements grow.</li>
</ul>

The options are too numerous to list even in a book, but the technologies that Synclop is considering are:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP: One of the oldest, most widely used technologies of the web. Powers more or less half the websites, if not much more.<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Veteran. Everyone knows how to use it, countless examples for any situation you might think of</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Portable, will work on any platform, including shared hosts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Node.js: the rising hip young language. Has been picked up quickly by a huge lot of companies small and big and is spreading like wildfire.<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Unparalleled speed, so very useful for, say, processing images</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Unparalleled ease of use and speed of development</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> Doesn&#39;t work on most shared hosts</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> Difficult to find programmers that have experience with it</li>
</ul>
