<ul>
<li><em>Adjacency Lists</em>: Each node keeps a reference to it&#39;s parent, or, more uncommonly, each parent keeps a list of children (or both, but data is then de-normalized and should be maintained at the application level).</li>
<li><em>Nested Sets</em>: each node sets &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; value to nodes to describe its &quot;spatial limits&quot; (using the term very liberally here). Thus a node that has &quot;left:1&quot; and &quot;right:20&quot; contains a node that has &quot;left:2&quot; and &quot;right:4&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjacency lists are more pleasing because more easily readable for a human, however it can become quickly cumbersome if the tree is deep (many requests become necessary to retrieve the tree in full). Special care must be taken at the application level because deleting a root node will not necessarily delete the children, which can lead to orphan nodes and bad references.  </p>
<h3>references</h3><ul>

</ul>
<hr>
<p>However, in the case of FAI, we probably cannot rely on pure tree structures. It is very likely that relationships can go in multiple ways, and so we probably need a way to model Directed Graphs or Directed Acyclic Graphs (DG and DAG). DG are cumbersome to use, because relationships (&quot;edges&quot;, in graph theory parlance) can &quot;cycle&quot;, and so special care must be taken to not fall into loops. DAG are safe from loops, which means algorithms can be simplified, but care must be taken to not create a loop (since the algorithm wouldn&#39;t cater for it and might run indefinitely). Here are some papers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hansolav.net/sql/graphs.html">Graphs and Graph Algorithms in T-SQL</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/Modeling_DAGs_on_SQL_DBs.aspx?msg=3051183">A Model to Represent Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) on SQL Databases</a></li>
<li><a href="http://techportal.inviqa.com/2009/09/07/graphs-in-the-database-sql-meets-social-networks/">Graphs in the database: SQL meets social networks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since manipulating DGs and DAGs by hand would be complex, I&#39;ve been looking for an ORM to help alleviate the problem. An ORM does &quot;Object Relational Mapping&quot;; basically, abstracts complexity and facilitates communication with the database. Unsurprisingly, very few have tree representation, and none has graph representations.</p>

</div></section><section><h2 id="vocabulary-and-quick-definitions/databases-section"><a href="./vocabulary-and-quick-definitions/databases">Databases</a></h2><div class="page"><p>Before going forward, it might be good to define a few words to make the following easier to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">Relational Databases</a>: Relational databases store data in tables. It might help to visualize them as excel sheets. Data in relational databases is <em>normalized</em> and <em>structured</em>. Relational databases also have developed a set of features that allow them to guarantee writes; in other words, in case of failure, the data stays uncorrupted. This set of features is referred to as</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a>: In computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>: &quot;SQL&quot; stands for &quot;Structured Query Language&quot;. It refers to the language that is used in the earliest databases to instruct the database how to store or retrieve data. By extension, it has become synonymous with &quot;relational databases&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>: NoSQL refers to a new wave of databases that are non-relational. Some of them <em>do</em> use SQL language, so the appellation is often a misnomer, and should be understood as &quot;not relational&quot;, and not as &quot;not using SQL&quot;. NoSQL databases include, but are not limited to:<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database">Document databases</a>: Databases that store information as a tree; A good visualization is a file system (folders containing other folders containing files). Document databases are specially useful for nested data, for speed, and for flexibility (since the data is, by design, not normalized, it&#39;s easy to add properties to any object). They have a reputation of being ACID-adverse, but huge technological improvements have been changing this in the last year.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">Graph databases</a>: Databases that establish links between things. This is specially useful for arbitrarily linking two objects (&quot;nodes&quot;, in graph parlance) with a link (&quot;edge&quot;) specifying a certain relation. They are widely used in social networks (X is &quot;friends&quot; with Y, A is &quot;going out with&quot; B). The landscape of Graph databases is mostly bare, with only a few dominating ones.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database">Key-Value Store</a>: Very simple databases that store every piece of data under a key. Imagine an excel sheet with only two columns, one of which is an identity field you can&#39;t fiddle with. The extreme simplification allows for extreme speeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>to sum it up</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relational databases</strong> express data as &quot;X <em>is</em> made of A, B, and C&quot;, such as &quot;a book <em>is</em> made of title, number of pages, and author&quot;. They have been in use for years and most problems that might arise have been already solved.</li>
<li><strong>Document databases</strong> express data as &quot;X <em>contains</em> A, B, and C&quot;, such as &quot;Contact <em>has</em> an address, the address <em>has</em> a street, a city, and a state&quot;. They are new, and hard problems are still arising nowadays.</li>
<li><strong>Graph databases</strong> express data as &quot;X <em>is in relation with</em> A, B, and C <em>and the quality of their relation is Y</em>&quot;, such as &quot;Alice <em>is friends with</em> Bob and Bob <em>is a member of</em> the local chess club&quot;. Graph databases are complex and as a result, very few open-source solutions are available today.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, to make things a bit more complex, some databases are <em>mixed</em>. OrientDb is a graph database that incorporates some relational features. PostgreSQL is a relational database, but as of it&#39;s latest version can also store and search &quot;documents&quot;.</p>
<p>In the case of the highly relational data we are dealing with, a graph database would make a lot of sense (photo X is &quot;in&quot; album Y, and is &quot;defined by&quot; terms A,B,and C), but choosing a graph database would mean doing away with ready-made solutions, as well as sacrificing somewhat future maintainability (most people have not even <em>heard</em> of noSQL databases, let alone graph databases).</p>
</div></section><section><h2 id="vocabulary-and-quick-definitions/hosting-platforms-section"><a href="./vocabulary-and-quick-definitions/hosting-platforms">Hosting Platforms</a></h2><div class="page"><p>Hosting platforms (where the website will reside) can be roughly categorized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared Hosting: This is the least costly solution. Server is shared between many users. There is a terrible loss in performance, but as most websites don&#39;t require much, in a lot of cases, this is enough. However, special solutions cannot be installed on shared hosts (typically), which means losing quite a good amount of flexibility</li>
<li>Private Dedicated Managed Server: This is the most costly solution, but the most flexible too. As the name implies, a machine is dedicated to your website only.</li>
<li>Private Dedicated Self-Managed Server: This is the same as above, but slightly less costly, as you are supposed to manage the server yourself. Any problem that arises is yours to fix (unless it&#39;s a hardware problem). Which means you have to hire your own IT, but having someone on a retainer fee might be enough</li>
<li>Private Virtual Managed Server: This is a mid-way between shared hosting and private servers. It&#39;s a private server, but in the cloud, and distributed over multiple PCs. The cost is also in the middle between a shared host and a private server</li>
<li>Private Virtual Self-Managed server: As you can guess, this is a virtual private server you manage yourself</li>
<li>Cloud Platform: This is the equivalent of a VPS (Virtual Private Server), but it scales up automatically with your requirements, so it can end up being much stronger than a dedicated server. However, the pricing scheme is often complex, very low as long when your requirements are low, but climbing up exponentially as your requirements grow.</li>
</ul>

The options are too numerous to list even in a book, but the technologies that Synclop is considering are:</p>
